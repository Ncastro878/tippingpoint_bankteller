HOW IT WORKS

Tipping Point is an app that helps you collect money from people to plan group projects or events.

Tipping Point is different from other crowdfunding services because Tipping Point fundraisers only collect money from contributors if the project or event (from now on just "event") is guaranteed to occur.

Event creators set certain requirements (like a minimum amount of money to raise and/or a minimum number of attendees) along with a deadline for invitees to opt-in.

If the requirements are met before the deadline, the event "tips" and Tipping Point automatically transfers funds from those who opted-in to the event creator. Tipping Point takes a small fee (1.5%) for this service.

If the requirements aren't met before the deadline, nothing happens and no fees are charged.

TIPPING POINT EVENTS

There are four types of Tipping Point events, based on the requirements creators want to set.

The first two, Sliding Scale and Headcount, result in every attendee paying the same price. The number of attendees is often capped, e.g. for in-person events.

The latter two, Make or Break and Anything Helps, are fundraising options where invitees can contribute whatever they'd like, and any number of attendees can participate.

1. Sliding Scale events are for when you need a specific amount of money, regardless of the number of attendees.

The final price per person will change depending on how many invitees opt in. As more people join, the cost per person goes down.

Examples:

-Booking a vacation home to share with friends
-Renting a venue (like a restaurant, ballroom, or community center) for a party or event
-Group activities like boat rentals, taxis, or party busses where the companies charge a flat group rate
-Crowdfunding a project with a predefined startup cost, like a business venture or construction project

2. Headcount events are for when the price per person is set from the start, and you just need to ensure a minimum number of people participate.

Examples:

-Buying or selling tickets to a concert, performance, or sporting event (venues can ensure a profitable attendance; attendees can book rows or sections with friends)
-Hiring a chef or caterer for a group event (there's often a set price per guest, but a minimum number of guests required)
-Booking people like tour guides, tutors, or yoga teachers where the instructor charges per person

3. Make or Break fundraisers are for when you need to raise at least a minimum amount of money the project to happen.

Make or Break fundraisers can still raise more than that, but won't tip unless they reach their minimum.

Examples:

-Funding a construction project
-Starting a small business or launching a product
-Producing a film, album, or other creative work
-Funding scientific research projects or expeditions

4. Anything Helps fundraisers have no minimums - the event will tip as long as there's at least one contribution.

Examples:

-Crowdfunding medical expenses
-Fundraising for disaster relief/humanitarian aid
-Collecting donations for charities and non-profits
-Funding campaigns for personal projects or creative works with no fixed budget
-Crowdfunding things like honeymoons, adoption fees, etc.

WEB3

Tipping Point uses a series of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain to transfer funds between users, providing several important web3 benefits:

Seizure Resistance: Funds are always self-custodied by users in their wallets. Tipping Point smart contracts merely route contributions from attendees to event creators when an event tips; Tipping Point never takes possession of user funds.

Censorship Resistance and Privacy: Tipping Point doesn't require any personal or financial information to set up an account and has no way of stopping a transaction once it's been submitted to the Ethereum network.

Users can simply connect their wallets and start using Tipping Point - no personal data or permission required.

Data Security: Because Tipping Point doesn't require users to provide sensitive data, that information is never at risk of being abused or stolen.

Phone numbers and email addresses are optional, and only used to enhance the Tipping Point experience (users can receive text and email notifications; find friends on the app more easily; opt-in to Tipping Point communications; etc.).

Lightning-fast Transactions: Tipping Point eliminates financial intermediaries (like banks, credit card companies, and payment processors) and instead connects users directly to their peers on the blockchain.

Like Ethereum, Tipping Point runs 24/7/365 - no more waiting days for payments to settle or for the bank to open. Once an event tips, creators can collect their funds immediately.

Lowest Fees: By cutting out the middlemen, Tipping Point can offer the lowest crowdfunding fees out there: a mere 1.5%. And users only pay fees for events that tip - no risk, all reward.
