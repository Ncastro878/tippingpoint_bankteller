Tipping Point - About Us

<b>The Future of Community Funding</b>

Welcome to Tipping Point, a better way to raise money from your community for projects and events.

With Tipping Point, you're in control. Create an event, set your targets, and invite your network. You only move forward if the project hits your goals —guaranteeing that every contribution counts.

Try as many events as you like for free - attendees only pay a small fee if it succeeds. And once it "tips," you'll have your funds immediately, so you can book that venue, buy those tickets, or start that project right away.

Our innovative web3 platform cuts out the traditional financial middlemen and connects you directly with your network, enabling instant transactions and lower fees than any other crowdfunding platform.

Smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain route funds directly from contributors to project creators, and the network's decentralized design ensures transactions can't be censored and users can't be deplatformed - enabling true financial freedom for global crowdfunding.

There's no upfront cost and no personal or financial information required. Just connect your wallet, set a display name, and start bringing your ideas to life.

It's community peer-to-peer funding made smooth, simple, and secure, so you can focus on what matters: bringing people together.

Welcome to modern crowdfunding. Welcome to Tipping Point.

<b>What We Do</b>

Moving money around these days is easy, but coordinating social consensus around projects or events is <i>hard</i>:

-Sometimes the price of an event depends on how many people opt in, but most people won't opt in until they know the price.

-Sometimes people only want to participate if they know other people are participating too.

-People frequently drop out or have to cancel at the last minute.

-Project creators often have to choose between attempting to collect money up front or risking their own funds in order to bring their event to life. If not enough people opt in, creators might  lose their money or at best have to go through the hassle of issuing refunds.

Tipping Point solves these problems by helping you first plan and coordinate your events, based on the number of attendees you want and the amount of money you need to raise. Then, if you hit your targets, your project "tips" and you receive precisely the funding you need.

Creating an event is simple: just add the details, define your goals, set a deadline, and invite your network. Once enough people participate, your project tips — and the funds are immediately sent to you on the blockchain.

Tipping Point uses a series of smart contracts on the Ethereum network to route funds between participants, so users log in with a web3 wallet instead of the traditional username and password. There's no personal or financial data required, and Tipping Point never has access to user funds, which are always self-custodied in users' wallets.

(Don't have a wallet? No problem, it's free to set up and only takes a minute.)

Once you're connected Tipping Point does the rest - and thanks to its innovative web3 backbone Tipping Point can offer its users the fastest, cheapest, and most secure crowdfunding experience out there.

With Tipping Point, you're free to dream big. Whether it's your local church community, an anonymous group chat, your social media followers, or the entire world, Tipping Point helps connect you to the people you care about so you can bring your ideas to life.
